## Colophon

This website uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator. Markdown files are edited using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and are pushed to a [Github Repository](https://github.com/francisrmatt/eleventy-site) which runs a Github 'action', running 11ty to generate the HTML from the markdown and layout template files. The output HTML is deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). [^1]

Below are three websites, the latter two made in reference to the previous.

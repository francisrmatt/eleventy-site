## Colophon

This website uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator. Markdown files are edited using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and are pushed to a [Github Repository](https://github.com/francisrmatt/eleventy-site) which runs a Github 'action', running 11ty to generate the HTML from the markdown and layout template files. The output HTML is deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). 

## Design philosophy

Below are three websites, the latter two made in reference to the previous.

- https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/
- http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/
- https://thebestmotherfucking.website/

While all three claim to be satire they all call into question perceptions of modern web design.

### The first site

Pure HTML.

### The second site

With some CSS.

### The third site

Added Javascript.
